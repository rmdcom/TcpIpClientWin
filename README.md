# TcpIpClientWin
The Windows tcpclient.exe program was compiled with the ancient MSVC 5.0, but the simple program could be rebuilt with any Win32 compiler, I would expect.  I would have used Eclipse, but Eclipse is broken on my Windows PC at the moment.  It complains about the damn Java version.  (Maybe a conflict with the AVR32 Workbench's Java version requirements.)
